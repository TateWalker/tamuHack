# Password Manager for TAMUHack

Small application to encrypt passwords and store in database online. Consists of 2 python scripts that handle server generation and a C# program to create a client-side interface for accessing the server.

## Notes on server:
  * You must get the ethernet IP from your server machine and change the target URLs in the C# program to this address.
  * Ethernet IP value will change everytime you connect to the wifi.
